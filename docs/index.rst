Motivations
===========

Despite xarray supports natively import/export of `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`_ (a file format designed to efficiently store and organize large amount of data), it does not provide an integrated interface to the `NeXus file format <https://www.nexusformat.org/>`_, the standard *de facto* for scientific data storage, based on HDF5 and increasingly adopted in `laboratories and large-scale facilities <https://www.nexusformat.org/Facilities.html>`_ all over the world.

With this respect, the `nxarray <https://nxarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package comes into play, bridging xarray with the NeXus format. This package actually extends xarray, providing convenient loading and saving methods for NeXus files, directly to *Datasets* objects. The architecture of a NeXus file resembles the structure of an xarray *Dataset*, and indeed both of them are specifically designed for handling scientific data with its relevant metadata.

``nxarray`` is part of the `reScipy project <https://rescipy-project.readthedocs.io>`_.
